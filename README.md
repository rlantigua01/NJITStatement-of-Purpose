# September 2022, Statement of Purpose, Rolando Lantigua
As I am typing this, I'm thinking of all the ways I could be messing this up. At this very moment in time, I'm at my lowest I will ever be in life even though I'm in the most positive mindset. Thus far, I came and understood that I endured a lot in the short amount of time I spent alive. That dramatically shaped why I faced the circumstances I looked to overcome. 

What I'm facing now is a reality crisis. I'm at a stage in life where I am reflecting on what is happening, why it is happening, and what is occuring because of it. I'd like to take control of that. Fortunately enough, despite all the hardship I faced, I also was blessed with many opportunities, which in hindsight, either way; disappointed me because I didin't do better with those advantages, but I realized as an adult, I was just a kid. From actuality, that being a reason for this, what I am facing now; the bluntness of how I am wishing to live a life worth living in my lifetime. I want to be better, smarter, and irreplaceably employable. Truly, I want to become a part of the team at, Apple. 

When I ponder over that thought, I also remember I'm not alone in that dream and the fierce competition there is. Not to mention, the desire plus commitment to excellence that it requires from an individual. So with that in mind, I ought to do something in order to get ahead and advance my skills. As I mentioned, I faced a reality crisis. I wished I studied STEM in college, I wished I did better in high school, I wished my parents were educated, or at least that I applied myself more. Everything in my life, at one point, seems to have a reason; but, it isn't as large as the reason I have now, to leave the world full of dreams. Dreams of what is possible. Lately, this perspective required me to be fired from every job I ever held, the pain I felt from all my lost friends, potential homelessness, and almost bankruptcy. From the late great, Steve Jobs, he said: "You can't connect the dots looking forward... life, karma, whatever." I am seeing, looking back, I am enduring, in order to continue learning. Since then, I learned more, and I saw the consequences without a graduate degree. 

In order to begin taking control, becoming part of the Apple team, and leaving the world dreaming of what is going to be possible; I'm requiring more education. As I scholarly grow, I exponentially can increase what I earn, and this flexibility allows me the efforts I daily make in order to leave impacts. My statement of purpose in this application and hope for scholarships is a chance to leave a lot of people with dreams. 

Take regards. Thanks so much. 

Best,

Rolando
